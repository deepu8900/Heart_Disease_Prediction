# Heart_Disease_Prediction
ðŸ«€ Heart Disease Prediction Model
This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health metrics, using the Kaggle Heart Disease dataset.

ðŸ“Œ Features
Logistic Regression model for binary classification.

User-friendly CLI to input patient details.

Predicts whether the person has heart disease or not.

Built with Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
We use the Heart Disease dataset with the following features:

age â†’ Age of the patient

sex â†’ 1 = male, 0 = female

cp â†’ Chest pain type (0â€“3)

trestbps â†’ Resting blood pressure

chol â†’ Serum cholesterol (mg/dl)

fbs â†’ Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = yes, 0 = no)

restecg â†’ Resting electrocardiographic results (0â€“2)

thalach â†’ Maximum heart rate achieved

exang â†’ Exercise induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)

oldpeak â†’ ST depression induced by exercise

slope â†’ Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0â€“2)

ca â†’ Number of major vessels (0â€“3)

thal â†’ Thalassemia (1 = normal, 2 = fixed defect, 3 = reversible defect)
